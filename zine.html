    <h2>FLAWLESS HACKS ZINE #01: OUR TECH JOURNEY</h2>
    <h3>About the Project</h3>
    <p>Flawless Hacks is a non-profit organization committed to supporting women and non-binary people in tech. We are extending our programming to create a zine in hopes of giving a platform for traditionally unheard voices in tech and also present a diverse set of experiences. 

For our first issue, “Our Tech Journey,” we are asking people to submit art that explores their early relationships with technology and how that’s developed over time. We also welcome submissions that explore the first time you felt interested in tech.

We draw inspiration from illustrating Flawless Hacks organizers’ stories (here, here, here, here) and articles such as “'Neopets': Inside Look at Early 2000s Internet Girl Culture” that explore the ways people have become interested in technology. Some additional examples of early tech culture include online communities on sites such as Gaia Online, DeviantArt, MySpace etc. and devices such as GameBoy, Tamagochi, etc. 
    </p>
